# üëã AI Devs Langflow Competition - Solutions by Imtiaz

Welcome to my repository for the **AI Devs Langflow Competition**! This competition spans over 5 weeks, with progressively challenging tasks designed to explore cutting-edge AI topics such as **Prompt Engineering**, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, and **Agents**.

## üèÜ Competition Overview & Repository Structure

The competition consists of three main challenges. My solutions are organized into the following folders:

- **Challenge 1: Prompt Engineering**  
  The solution for this challenge can be found inside the `Challenge 1` folder, where prompt engineering techniques are applied to optimize AI responses.

- **Challenge 2: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**  
  Explore my RAG implementation inside the `Challenge 2` folder, focusing on combining generative AI with external data retrieval.

- **Challenge 3: Agents**  
  The `Challenge 3` folder contains the solution for building agents capable of performing tasks autonomously using AI.

Each folder includes a detailed README file, guiding you through the individual files, how to run the solutions, and evaluate the outputs.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

To explore the solutions for each challenge:

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/imtiazx/LangflowHackathon.git
   cd LangflowHackathon
   ```

2. Navigate to the challenge folder you're interested in, e.g., for **Challenge 1**:  
   ```bash
   cd "Challenge 1"
   ```

3. Follow the instructions in the README file within each challenge folder to run the code or evaluate the solution.
